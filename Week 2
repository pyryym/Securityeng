TASK 1a:
-The not secure warning means that the website does not use HTTPS. Which means the data is not encrypted and thus not secure.
-The second site uses HTTPS and the browser just recognizes that, even tho it looks like the site is not the real bank website.
- I think that there are many tools online to check if the website is real or not. I personally have had F-secure installed on some of my computers and I think it verifies the websites when you try to open them, and I think even google chrome has something built in for it. 
BUt usually you should be extra careful about the spelling and look for any errors when trying to determine if a site is a scam website.
- Typosquatting is what is happening here and is what scammers use. So when you have legit website with an address, you make websites with simial adrress but slight variation like typos. So when people in hurry write the website address and make the typo they instead get directed to your website.
-UDRP is a policy that is used by companies against people who try typosquatting against them
-if I owned domain ouspg.org I would look for any domain names that could be cause of misspelling. Also ouspg.net or other tlds could be used.
