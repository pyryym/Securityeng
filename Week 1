Task 1:
I personally use different passwords in most of the services and use couple password managers to save them. I always use two factor authentication when its possible. I have couple passwords I use for services I only need like once or twice and that
dont really have anything personal stuff I would care about. I have not been victim of cyber crimes, atleast not that I know of. But I know there have few times someone has tried to log in to some of my accounts and my two factor authentication software has notified me of that.
I think I could improve on by using just one password manager because rn I find myself too often not being able to login to somewhere because the manager is on another device,

Task 4a:

1. Did you find devices you did not know were in your network?  - No I did not find. Actually I found out that some of my devices that should be on network had actually dissappeared and it seems like they have lost the power at some point.
2. Were there open ports which should have been closed?   - No I did not find any ports which should have been closed
3. Did nmap find any vulnerabilities with the scripts?   - No vulnerabilities were found
4. Screenshot of the topology of your network. You can redact device information if you want.

Task 4b: 

1. Has your account details leaked?   - No they have not been leaked
2. Screenshot of haveibeenpwned search, you can redact information if you want.
3. Did you change passwords and/or email + password combos, that were leaked, if not, do it.



Feedback:
I found these tasks super interesting, especially nmap. I love the tool and would love to learn more tricks about using it. 
The task 3 also sounds interesting but since I have been sick for almost last 2 weeks unfortunately didnt have the time to try it out.
